        title: 'Joe\'s Bar',
        description: 'You\'ve been to Joe\'s before, it\'s a seedy spot owned by the establishment\'s namesake who\'s a crooked ex-cop. When you arrive the place is dead. There are a few sad fools drinking their lives away while Joe pretends to clean glasses behind the bar. You address Joe, "You still running games downstairs?" He stares blankly at you. "I guess so," answering your own question. You open the well-used door marked DO NOT ENTER and descend the stairs. Down here there\'s noise, smoke, and excitement. You address the room, "Anyone been here recently that likes to write notes on napkins?" "Maybe." A pencil-thin man says out of the corner of his mouth. "Maybe we play for it?" you propose. He smiles, "Your funeral, sucker!"',

        clue: '"Ha!" the barber emits with a smoker\'s hack. "Your\'re smarter than you look. Thanks, friend. Whaddya need to know?" You ask him if he shaves a man with a glass eye. "That hoity-toity lummox! Yeah, he\'s always jabbering about wining and dining half the town and how his view of the entire city always seals the deal. He talks so much I\'ve nearly cut off his Adam\'s apple." You quip, "At least one of you talks." It flies over his head and out the window as he scrunches his face. You get up to leave, "Thanks, chum."',
        title: 'Mane Street Barbers',
        description: 'You can smell the sandalwood from the street. This must be the place the pencil-thin man was yapping about. Unfortunately it looks like it\'s closed. Fortunately you see a balding barber inside crouched over a newspaper playing the crosswords. After knocking on the door the barber greets you, "Get lost, chum! We\'re closed!" He turns to return to his rag. Keeping your composure you holler through the door, "Let me help you with that puzzle, friend." The barber halts in his tracks, "What\'s it to you, chum?" You clear your throat, "Just need some particulars on one of your customers." He opens up the door. "Well, I hope you aren\'t as dumb as you look. I\'ve got one word left, but it\'s got me flummoxed."',

        clue: 'Success! The door opens and you see Violet light up. You reach out a hand, "Let\'s get you out of here." She gasps as her face fills with TERROR! Her hand trembles and points over your shoulder. As you turn around you catch a blackjack right behind the ear. A dark pool opens up at your feet. You dive in. It has no bottom. You feel pretty good - like an amputated leg.',
        title: 'The Fibonacci Building',
        description: 'The doorman shows you to the private elevator when you announce you are an ophthalmologist personally delivering an ocular prosthesis. The elevator door opens and your eyes can barely take in the palatial, immaculate suite. The bar is fully-stocked. As you waltz towards the liquor a shout emanates from a corner room, "You loaf! Let me out!" "I\'m no loaf - I\'m a stout cookie," you reply. "Who\'s there?" the voice wimpers. You move towards the door, "I\'m here to help." You try the handle but it\'s locked with a strange contraption. "You\'re not him, but he\'ll be here soon. I\'ve heard him mutter the first three numbers under his breath: two, three, and five. You\'re gonna have to guess the fourth. Quickly, get it open before he gets back!"',
